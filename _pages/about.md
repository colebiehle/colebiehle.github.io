Hello, I'm Cole Biehle! I am currently a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) master's student at <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science</a>, advised by <a href="https://kittur.org/">Dr. Niki Kittur</a>.

My research investigates Human-AI Interaction at the intersection of creativity, sensemaking, and social computing. I develop AI-augmented tools that help groups organize information, share insights, and explore ideas more deeply. My goal is to improve how teams make sense of complex problems and generate innovative solutions.

Prior to CMU, I earned my B.S. in Cognitive Science (Design & Interaction) with a Minor in Computer Science from the <a href="https://ucsd.edu/">University of California San Diego</a>, where I was advised by <a href="https://spdow.ucsd.edu/">Dr. Steven Dow</a> and <a href="https://hxi.ucsd.edu/author/nadir-weibel/">Dr. Nadir Weibel</a> in the <a href="https://designlab.ucsd.edu/">Design Lab</a>. After graduating, I was a UX Research Consultant, directing product strategy for AI features at companies including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft, and securing Series A funding for Zelig (GenAI Startup).

I am passionate about building the next generation of collaborative human-AI systems and pioneering new research paradigms for augmented innovation.
