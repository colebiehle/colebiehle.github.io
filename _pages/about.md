Hello, I'm Cole Biehle! I am a graduate student in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) at Carnegie Mellon University's School of Computer Science, advised by <a href="https://hcii.cmu.edu/people/aniket-kittur">Professor Niki Kittur</a>.

My research investigates Human-AI Interaction at the intersection of creativity, sensemaking, and social computing. My core work focuses on developing novel AI-augmented design tools and computational reflection systems to address structural and cognitive bottlenecks in R&D workflows. I design and evaluate systems that facilitate collective sensemaking and significantly improve the novelty and value of ideas generated during collaborative ideation.

Prior to CMU, I earned my B.S. in Cognitive Science with a Minor in Computer Science from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), where I was advised by Dr. Steven Dow and Dr. Nadir Weibel. I subsequently worked as a UX Research Consultant for technology leaders including Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. I analyzed early AI features across 10+ Google product teams, influencing strategic roadmaps for systems reaching billions of users, and drove the strategic narrative for Zelig (GenAI Startup), contributing to a $15M Series A funding round.

I am passionate about building the next generation of collaborative human-AI systems and pioneering new research paradigms for augmented innovation.
